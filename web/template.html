                                Working predominantly in Java, I implement various financial models and build user
                                interfaces (both web and pdf). In this role I have significantly improved my
                                understanding of industrial software development. I am confident with OOP principles and
                                how/when to apply them. As well as Java, I use SQL daily, and have also spent
                                significant time maintaining and extending my company’s C code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For web development, we work with Apache Tapestry. Web pages and their components are
                                built in Java and an html templating language.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a specific example, for more complex and resource-intensive financial calculations,
                                we have a C implementation that runs against the database to create cached data
                                structures. We also have an equivalent Java implementation of the same calculations. We
                                then test the code by running the two implementations against every instance in the
                                database to confirm that they produce the same result, as well as running unit tests and
                                other forms of integration tests. We can be very confident in the results we produce.

                                patent applications. The patent applications were primarily software related but also
                                pertained to mechanical engineering. In particular, applications often concerned
                                cryptographic algorithms and obfuscation. During this role, I significantly improved my

                                with Barclays bank. This required coding in PL/SQL as well as the proprietary Avaloq

                                decide how to implement them in the system. A significant challenge was ensuring the
